COPYING PROHIBITED PURSUANT TO GC 69954 (d)
616

-~ 1 | condition the car was in when you observed it?

2 A. Best way to describe it is that it was inoperable.

3 | It appeared damaged enough to not be able to move it out of

4} -- move it out of that area.

5 Q. And can you please describe in a little more detail

6 | what the area it was in was like? .

7 A. Yeah. It was dense vegetation. It was an ;

8 | embankment so it was tough to -- even for the tow truck, to

9] pull it out of. That's the best way I can describe it.

10 Q. Let me ask you this. The road that you were

11 | walking on, in your initial clip, that appeared relatively

12 | flat; is that fair to say?

13 A. Yes. ;
om 14 Q. When you think about where the car was situated,

15 | was that -- did that continue to be flat or was it a slope?

16 A. It was a slope after the curb.

1? Q. So after the curb met the roadway, this part -- the

18 | embankment that you're talking about, it's a slope into

19 | that portion?

20 A. Yes.

21 Q. Why did the car appear inoperable to you?

22 A. The ignition appeared to be tampered with. I

23 | believe I -- I don't -- yeah, just appeared inoperable

24 | because of that.

25 Q. Now, with respect to the color of the car, were you

26 | able to tell what color the car was?

27 A. At first glance it appeared black to me. Umm, and
aN 28 | then after looking at it, it looked like it had just

617
— 1 | freshly been painted.
2 Q. Were -- why did it appear freshly painted to you?
3 A. Some areas were darker than others. There was
4 | paint cans in the area.
5 Q. When you were able to look more closely at the car,
6 | were you able to tell if there was any color underneath the
7 | paint you saw?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. And what color was that?
10 A. White.
11 Q. When you were speaking with the defendant, were you
12 | able to observe his hands?
13 A. Yes.
~ 14 Q. Did you notice anything about his hands?
15 A. I did. I noticed --
16 Q. Tell us about that.
17 A. I noticed his hands were covered with black either
18 | old paint or new paint.
19 Q. Let's talk about the rear license plate on the car.
20 | Did that match the vehicle that you were looking at?
21 A. Somewhat. It matched that it was a Chevrolet van,
22} and that's all the information that we were given at that
23 | point.
24 Q. Was anyone else on scene with you at this point of
25 | the investigation?
26 A. At this point, yes.
27 Q. Who was that?
os 28 A. Officer Daniels.

COPYING PROHIBITED PURSUANT TO GC 69954 (d)
618
pom, 1 Q. And what did he do?
2 A. He checked the VIN that's located on the front
3 | portion of the vehicle.
4 Q. In your investigation, did you learn what kind of
5 | car the rear license plate led back to or was that Officer
6 | Daniels? .
7 A. I -- I got the initial return from the license 2
8 | plate so I knew that it was -- and I don't recall the year
9} but that it was a Chevrolet van.
10 Q. Would it refresh your recollection as to the year
11 | of the van to review a copy of your police report?
12 A. Yes, ma'am.
13 MS. STEPHENSON: May I approach the witness, Your
am, 14 | Honor?
; 15 THE COURT: Yes, you may.

17 | police report, please review the report and look up at me
18 | if and when your memory has been refreshed.
19 A. Yes, it has.
20 QO. Okay. So the license plates that were affixed to
21 | the car, what year Chevy did it come back to?
22 A. 2005.
23 Q. Why was that significant to you in your
24 | investigation?
25 A. Because it was later determined that the van we had
26 | was not a 2005 Chevy van.
27 Q. What year was it?
en 28 A. I'd have to look at my report to recollect my
PATRICK K. CROWLEY, CSR, CRR, CRC

619

~~ 1} memory.

2 Q. If that would refresh your memory, go ahead and

3 | look at your report and look up at me when your memory's

4 | been refreshed.

5 A. I'm sorry. I got it the other way around. So

6 | initially I was -- now looking at my report, it was a 2004

7 | van that the license plate had attached. After looking at -

8 | the VIN, it was 2005 so just one year off.

9 THE COURT: I don't understand.

10 Q. (By Ms. Stephenson) So are you saying that the

11} license plate on the car returned to the 2005?

12 A. That's my correction. It was 2004.

13 Q. Okay. Go ahead and return the report to me,
a, 14 | please.

15 A. Yes, ma'am.

16 Q. Okay. So this investigation happened in 2021; is

17 | that fair to say?

18 A. Yes, ma'am.

19 Q. And how many investigations do you think you've

20 | done between this investigation and now?

21 A. A lot.

24 | today?

14 A. Not necessarily, but it could have been.

o 15 THE COURT: What does it mean to be punched out?
16 THE WITNESS: Oh. Based on other stolen vehicle
17 | investigations that I've had, I've seen where the whole
18 | ignition is taken off because suspects use improvised
19 | tools, most of the time hand-held tools. And when they --
20 | this is where the term comes. They punch the improvised
21] tool into the ignition comes the term. The ignition is
22 | punched so it creates so much damage that the ignition is
23 | -- is either punched out or is still in intact in some way.
24 THE COURT: Thank you. Go ahead.

25 MR. SAMUELS: Thank you, Your Honor.
